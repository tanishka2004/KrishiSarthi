## ü§ù Future Integration Plan

To make this a full-stack application, backend developers can build and provide APIs for each feature. Here's how integration is planned:

| Feature           | API Requirement                                              |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Weather Updates   | Real-time weather data from APIs like OpenWeatherMap         |
| Crop Management   | Dynamic crop tips based on location, season, and crop type   |
| Market Insights   | Live mandi prices from government databases or APIs          |
| Government Schemes| Region and language-specific scheme data                     |

The frontend is designed to easily integrate with these APIs using `fetch` or `axios`.
